## PlugPortal
This project is a framework for xPlug's portal development projects

## Tools
It combines angular (v5) with nodeJs (express). nodeJs is used to create the angular components and import statements

## Running the application
First, from your command prompt (make sure you are in the project directory) run the command:
'yarn' OR 'npm install' to install node_modules into your project

'ng serve' starts the angular application, usally @ http://localhost:4200 unless another port was specified. It is necessary to also run:

'npm run plug' OR 'nodemon emulator.js' to serve the nodeJs application for angular component creation. This runs @ http://localhost:4000

## Final words
All set? Then you are good to go. Enjoy developing.

Cheers!
